# Fast Talker
Fast Talker is a native extension of earlier work to establish a free and open source application for use in the treatment of communication disorders.  Fast Tasker is built upon Xamarin Forms and CocosSharp2d, both open-source frameworks for use in native development of applications for Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, and Blackberry.  Fast Talker is fully supported on all platforms, though only Android and iOS are actively maintained and under evaluation at this point.

Features include:
  - Native views in both iOS and Android
  - Dynamically add picture icons and text
  - Includes single item and autoclitic frame support
  - Constructs speech output using native functionality
  - Dynamically resize, mark icons, and apply other within-stimulus prompts
  - Incorporate images from anywhere, including your own camera and local pictures
  - Save boards automatically, all locally managed
